# Washington Trust Bank
Since 1902, Washington Trust Bank has strived to provide quality service and financial stability for our customers. Four generations of Stanton family leadership later, we continue to focus on integrity and commitment to community.

As the oldest and largest privately held commercial bank in the Northwest, with more than 40 financial centers and offices in Washington, Idaho and Oregon, we enjoy an advantage over our publicly owned competitors. We base our decisions and policies on what’s happening right here in the Northwest—not in distant locales. Being independent, we are able to set our sights on long-term goals rather than quarterly results. We stay focused on doing the right things for our clients and our communities.
